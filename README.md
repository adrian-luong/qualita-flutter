Qualita is a task management application, available for web and eventually Windows and Android, designed for personal usage and growth. Specifically:
    ***Managing** different personal projects and tasks, tracking their progression via steps.
    ***Planning** scheduled events, appointments and time for work and rest.
    ***Notifying** you on tasks and events with regards to your privacy.

## Installation

Qualita is developed from [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
Please follow their instruction to install the framework for Web.
Installing the framework would also install its development language and its SDK [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

In addition, please install a Flutter plugin to your preferred IDE in order to develop this project faster and easier, as recommended by Flutter team:

- For Android Studio and IntelliJ: <https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio>
- For Visual Studio Code: <https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code>

Then, feel free to clone this project down to try:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrian-luong/qualita-flutter.git
cd qualita-flutter
```

If you have already installed the Flutter and its plugin, a command to install necessary Flutter Pub packages (defined in **pubspec.yml**) should automatically run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Then, you can use the installed plugin to run Qualita in your IDE.

## FAQ

### How is this "task management system" different from Trello or Jira?

- Qualita's UI is friendlier. We actively check and remove visual clutters that would affect user's experience.

### I heard the author mentioning about this and that Qualita. Which one is this?

- Qualita has been under developed for years. The author must have referred to previous versions, which was built from different technologies or frameworks.
- This repository contains the latest open-source development in Flutter and Dart.
- The author has planned for 2 separate editions of Qualita:
  - An open-source one for personal management (named **Personal Qualita**)
  - A closed-source one for enterprise management (named **Professional Qualita**)

### What are the differences between Personal and Proffesional Qualita?

- Professional edition would contains all Personal one's features, as well as:
  - User roles, group and member management.
  - Internal messaging system, including group messages.
  - Overall supports for media and email, meaning you would be able to send files
